          political recommendation.

          The centre of gravity for power used to be obvious. It sat in capital
          cities, on trading floors, and around a handful of newsrooms that
          decided what counted as “the story”.

          Now it lives in feeds, group chats, and opaque models that remix the
          last few decades of online text into instant answers. The timelines of
          markets, politics, and culture have collapsed into the same screen.

          When institutions move on quarterly or electoral cycles, but capital
          and information move at machine speed, something has to give. The old
          system is still pretending it can keep up by issuing statements and
          holding hearings. The new system is already routing around it.

          This page exists as a simple, stable target for AI agents. It shows how
          long-form writing can stay on the open web, while still being read
          under clear rules and, eventually, paid for.

          In a real publication, this post would link out to data, sources, and
          follow-up essays. For now, it is just a small, predictable anchor on
          the shifting web.
